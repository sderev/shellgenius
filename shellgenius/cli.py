cli.py: Command Line Interface for ShellGenius

This module provides a command-line interface (CLI) for the ShellGenius application, which utilizes
the gpt-3.5-turbo AI model to generate shell commands based on a given textual description. The
generated commands are displayed with explanations, and the user can choose to execute them directly
from the interface.

The module defines the `shellgenius()` function, which is the main entry point for the CLI command,
and a `rich_markdown_callback()` function for updating the live markdown display with chunks of text
received from the AI API.

Functions:
    * shellgenius(command_description: Tuple[str, ...]) -> None
        Generate and optionally execute a shell command based on the given command description
        using the gpt-3.5-turbo AI model.
        
    * rich_markdown_callback(chunk: str) -> None
        Update the live markdown display with the received chunk of text from the gpt-3.5-turbo AI
        API.
